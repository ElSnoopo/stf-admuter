# stf-admuter
Maybe the simplest, dumbest, and most spaghetti code containing ad muter for Spotify 0.9

A simple ad muter I created because the ads on Spotify are not only annoying, but also the worst productions known to man.
Currently only Spotify versions up to 0.9 are supported. Incompatible with version 1.0 and following!

Known major bugs:
- sporadic interaction with keystrokes during the muting process
- hiccups when started while an already blacklisted ad is playing
  workaround: quickly activate any window except Spotify after starting the ad muter
