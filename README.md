# stf-admuter
Maybe the simplest, dumbest, and most spaghetti code containing ad muter for Spotify 0.9

A simple ad muter I created to help people who don't need offline playing, etc. but still don't want to listen to the same ads all day.
Sadly Spotify canceled the Unlimited option some years ago, so I started to work on an alternative.

Currently only Spotify versions up to 0.9 are supported. Incompatible with version 1.0 and following!
For the work in progress version check out my testing branch.

Known major bugs:
- sporadic interaction with keystrokes during the muting process
- hiccups when started while an already blacklisted ad is playing
  workaround: quickly activate any window except Spotify after starting the ad muter
